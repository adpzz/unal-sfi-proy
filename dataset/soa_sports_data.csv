Depending on the task the most promising features are semi-automatically selected, processed, and visualized. Our aim is to help soccer analysts in finding the most important and interesting events in a match. We present a flexible, modular, and expandable layer-based system allowing in-depth analysis. The integration of Visual Analytics techniques into the analysis process enables the analyst to find interesting events based on classification and allows, by a set of custom views, to communicate the found results.

A novel, promising application is the data-driven analysis of team sport. Specifically, soccer matches comprise rich, multivariate movement data at high temporal and geospatial resolution. Capturing and analyzing complex movement patterns and interdependencies between the players with respect to various characteristics is challenging. So far, soccer experts manually post-analyze game situations and depict certain patterns with respect to their experience. We propose a visual analysis system for interactive identification of soccer patterns and situations being of interest to the analyst. Our approach builds on a preliminary system, which is enhanced by semantic features defined together with a soccer domain expert. The system includes a range of useful visualizations to show the ranking of features over time and plots the change of game play situations, both helping the analyst to interpret complex game situations.

"""soccer"" and ""analytics"" and ""world""",2013,35,Thesis,Machine Learning for Soccer Analytics,"Sports analytics has been successfully applied in sports like baseball and basketball. However, its application in soccer has been limited. Research in soccer analytics with Machine Learning techniques is limited and is mostly employed only for predictions. There is a need to find out if the application of Machine Learning can bring better and more insightful results in soccer analytics. In this thesis, we perform descriptive as well as predictive analysis of soccer matches and player performances. In soccer, it is popular to rely on ratings by experts to assess a player’s performance. However, the experts do not unravel the criteria they use for their rating. We attempt to identify the most important attributes of player’s performance which determine the expert ratings. In this way we find the latent knowledge which the experts use to assign ratings to players. We performed a series of classifications with three different pruning strategies and an array of Machine Learning algorithms. The best results for predicting ratings using performance metrics had mean absolute error of 0.17. We obtained a list of most important performance metrics for each of the four playing positions which approximates the attributes considered by the experts for assigning ratings. Then we find the most influential performance metrics of the players for determining the match outcome and we examine the extent to which the outcome is characterised by the performance attributes of the players. We found 34 performance attributes using which we can predict the match outcome with an accuracy of 63.4%. Next, we devise a method to aggregate individual player ratings to produce a set of team ratings and investigate how closely these team ratings can determine the match outcome. We create 27 different team rating attributes, and using 8 of these attributes aggregated over the player ratings for the current match we obtained a prediction accuracy of 90%. This indicates that the expert ratings are influenced by the match outcome. Then we use a weighted average method to aggregate team ratings over past match performances. We find that match outcomes are best characterised by the ratings for the current match. Next, we investigate how well the expert ratings for the past performances of players predict the next match outcome. We find that we could only manage a prediction accuracy of 53.4% because of the unpredictability of ‘draw’. We conclude that the outcome of a match is correlated to the ratings for the current match only.",University of Leuven,"Kumar, G.",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

We propose the FASST system (Football Analytics: Spatial and Statistical) as an instrument to evaluate player performance. In the basic FASST (BFASST) system, a plus/minus-metric subtracts goals conceded from goals scored for each player while on the pitch. Key improvements to the established hockey plus/minus-metric include control for opponents’ strength and for the importance of a goal helping to identify key players. While the plus/minus-metric identifies key players, the spatial portion provides reasons for the players’ performances adding to established spatial mapping techniques. This allows for valid comparisons of a team’s performance when a player was on/off the pitch. The dependent variables evaluating a player’s performance in B-FASST’s spatial analytics are team shots for/against. Maps were created representing the difference between when a player was on/off the pitch which identifies differences in the distribution of shots for/against under different scenarios. When the components of B-FASST work in concert, one can test specific hypotheses.

Thirty two senior national teams competing in the 2010 World-Cup in South Africa and twelve youth soccer clubs were selected for match analysis. The results of time distribution analysis showed a significant positive skewness (K-SZ =3, S=0.463, p=0.000) for losing possession of the ball, transition time in senior (K-SZ =1.82, S=1.57, p=0.003) and youth groups (K-SZ =2.85, S=1.29, p=0.002) and normal distribution for variability of time to losing the ball (K-SZ =1.07, S= ?0.280, p=0.19). The results of an independent t test showed that there was a significant difference (t=2.71, p=0.008) in transition time between youth and senior groups. In conclusion, this study showed that the number of times that the ball was lost increased near to a goal being conceded and the duration of the most recent loss was very close to goal-conceding.

We hope to discover new knowledge from a soccer ball-event dataset by applying different machine learning techniques. In this thesis we present three experiments that address three interesting questions in soccer that involve game prediction and team style. We approach each question by constructing features using the ball-event data, where an event is a pass, shot, etc., and applying machine learning algorithms. In the first experiment, we construct three models that use different features to predict which team won a given game, without any knowledge of goals. We achieve a top accuracy rate of 0.84 using an L2-regularized logistic regression classifier. We also investigate the feature weights to learn relationships between game events and a team's chances of success. In the second experiment we try several classifiers to predict which team produced the sequence of ball-events that occurred during a game. Despite the relatively small number of events per game, we achieved an accuracy rate of 0.345 for a 20-team classification task when using a RBF SVM. By learning which sequences are characteristic of teams we are potentially able to discover if successful teams have a common style. We also learn the efficacy of transforming ball-events into predefined symbols. Finally, in the third experiment, we predict which team attempted a given set of passes. We first construct 2D histograms of the locations of the origins of the passes. We then use the histograms as features in a 20-team classification task and discover that teams have characteristic passing styles, by achieving an accuracy rate of 0.735 using a learned K-NN classifier. The results demonstrate that approaching soccer analytics with a machine learning framework is effective. In addition to achieving good classification performance, we are able to discover useful, potentially actionable, knowledge by investigating the models and features that we construct.",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Kerr, M.

The outcome of each game in the championship was replaced by a synthetic outcome (win, loss or draw) based on the performance indicators computed for each team. We found that the final rankings in the simulated championships are very close to the actual rankings in the real championships, and show that teams with high ranking error show extreme values of a defense/attack efficiency measure, the Pezzali score.

For example, we observe that more than 90% of live streaming clients send their requests for the same video segment with an inter-arrival time of only 10 seconds. Moreover, the logs indicate that the server sends substantially less data than is actually reported to be received by the clients, and the origin server streams data to less clients than there really are.

Results indicated that there were only three performance indicators (Fouls Drawn, Fouls Committed and Tackles) that showed no differences among goalkeepers of high, intermediate and low levels of team. The sole indicator was Saves which differed for goalkeepers of all three team levels and also the sole varied indicator for goalkeepers of intermediate and low level teams when facing different opponent levels. High level team goalkeepers showed differences in none of their match performance indicators during matches won, drawn and lost. However, Saves (F2,244=6.459, p<0.01, &b.eta;p2=0.05) was the sole indicator which differed for low level team goalkeepers when the final outcome is different. Different variations in performance indicators were found depending on the match location for different team levels. The most interesting performance differential was that a goalkeeper of a high-level team had a higher number of Saves when playing against a low-level team than a high-level team or an intermediate-level team.

Analyses of team tactics require however detailed data from various sources including technical skill, individual physiological performance, and team formations among others to represent the complex processes underlying team tactical behavior. Accordingly, little is known about how these different factors influence team tactical behavior in elite soccer. In parts, this has also been due to the lack of available data. Increasingly however, detailed game logs obtained through next-generation tracking technologies in addition to physiological training data collected through novel miniature sensor technologies have become available for research. This leads however to the opposite problem where the shear amount of data becomes an obstacle in itself as methodological guidelines as well as theoretical modelling of tactical decision making in team sports is lacking. The present paper discusses how big data and modern machine learning technologies may help to address these issues and aid in developing a theoretical model for tactical decision making in team sports. As experience from medical applications show, significant organizational obstacles regarding data governance and access to technologies must be overcome first.

CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes.

The types of ball possession are classified as Individual Ball Possession (IBC), Individual Ball Action (IBA), Individual Ball Control (IBC), Team Ball Possession (TBP), Team Ball Control (TBC) und Team Playmaking (TPM) according to different starting points and endpoints and the type of ball control involved. The machine learning approach used is able to determine how long the ball spends in the sphere of influence of a player based on the distance between the players and the ball together with their direction of motion, speed and the acceleration of the ball. The degree of ball control exhibited during this phase is classified based on the spatio-temporal configuration of the player controlling the ball, the ball itself and opposing players using a Bayesian network. The evaluation and application of this approach uses data from 60 matches in the German Bundesliga season of 2013/14, including 69,667 IBA intervals. The identification rate was F = .88 for IBA and F = .83 for IBP, and the classification rate for IBC was ? = .67. Match analysis showed the following mean values per match: TBP 56:04 ± 5:12 min, TPM 50:01 ± 7:05 min and TBC 17:49 ± 8:13 min.

Image processing and machine learning techniques that allow for “live” recognition and tracking of players exist. But these methods are far from collecting and analyzing event data fully autonomously. To generate accurate results, human interaction is required at different stages including system setup, calibration, supervision of classifier training, and resolution of tracking conflicts. Furthermore, the real-time constraints are challenging: in contrast to other object recognition and tracking applications, we cannot treat data collection, annotation, and learning as an offline task. A semi-automatic labeling of training data and robust learning given few examples from unbalanced classes are required. We present a real-time system acquiring and analyzing video sequences from soccer matches. It estimates each player’s position throughout the whole match in real-time. Performance measures derived from these raw data allow for an objective evaluation of physical and tactical profiles of teams and individuals. The need for precise object recognition, the restricted working environment, and the technical limitations of a mobile setup are taken into account. Our contribution is twofold: (1) the deliberate use of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques allows us to achieve high classification accuracy in varying environments. We systematically evaluate combinations of image features and learning machines in the given online scenario. Switching between classifiers depending on the amount of training data and available training time improves robustness and efficiency. (2) A proper human–machine interface decreases the number of required operators who are incorporated into the system’s learning process. Their main task reduces to the identification of players in uncertain situations. Our experiments showed high performance in the classification task achieving an average error rate of 3 % on three real-world datasets.

UT Austin Villa’s ball detection system was overhauled in order to transition from the league’s bright orange ball, used every year of the competition prior to 2016, to the truncated icosahedral pattern commonly associated with soccer balls.

This paper aims to: (i) detect match-fixing corruption in tennis and (ii) predict such match-fixing before it occurs. We first compare proxy measures of effort in fair matches versus possibly unfair matches - matches played in the first round, where wagering-induced manipulation is more likely. The results show that players exert less effort (tanking) in the first round, even when adjusting for the slightly greater difference in skill level in such matches. We next determine whether the gambling markets were able to identify fixing, tanking, or other types of manipulation before the match was played. Using two predictive tennis models (ELO, Common-Opponent) to determine the fair trading price of a tennis match, we find prima facie evidence of the betting markets being affected, with an average of 23 matches per year likely being manipulated or outright fixed each year. Finally, we determine whether fixed matches can be identified before they are played using predictive modeling and by observing real-time market price changes. We conclude that when the betting price has a large irrational move away from the fair model-predicted price, the move is indicative of a fixed match before it is played.",Journal of prediction markets,"Rodenberg, R.

Consequently, the purpose of this qualitative study was to better understand the lived experiences of highly identified soccer fanatics living through this era of match fixing in the sport. Social networking site Twitter was utilized to recruit participants from three continents – Africa, Europe, and North America – based on submissions to the site in response to a perceived fix from a high-profile March, 2013 match. A total of 12 semi-structured interviews were conducted with highly identified soccer fans in accordance with Funk and James’ (2001) Psychological Continuum Model (PCM). Despite the majority of participants feeling skepticism about the purity of soccer today, half of the participants’ fandom remained unchanged in the face of perceived match fixing. Directions for future research and recommendations are considered and discussed.",Brock University,"Lamberti, A.",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

Triclustering, based on Formal Concept Analysis (FCA), was developed to detect groups of objects with similar properties under similar conditions. It is used in Social Network Analysis (SNA) and is a basis for certain types of recommender systems. The problem of triclustering algorithms is that they do not always produce meaningful clusters. This article describes a specific triclustering algorithm and a prototype of a visual analytics platform for working with obtained clusters. This tool is designed as a testing frameworkis and is intended to help an analyst to grasp the results of triclustering and recommender algorithms, and to make decisions on meaningfulness of certain triclusters and recommendations.",Arxiv,"Kashnitsky, Y.",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-

However, a growing body of research documents officiating biases in sports. We focus on bias among major college football referees. Following a natural experiment approach, we contrast in-conference games with a quasi-control group consisting of games involving teams from different conferences. Specifically, we find a significant relationship between the betting line, a proxy for relative team strengths within each contest, and penalties among ACC and former Big East officials that suggests bias towards the underdog team within in-conference games. Additionally, we find home field bias in the ACC and Big XII and bias of game pace in the Big XII and former Big East. We also do a preliminary examination of the biases’ roots. Some biases we pinpoint are, counterintuitively, revenue-inhibiting for certain conferences. Our results show the potential impact on-field referees have on games and the underlying revenue streams for the conferences. They also highlight oft-discussed, but rarely researched, officiating biases at the intersection of game integrity and the commercial goals of the competing programs and the conferences they represent. To lessen such friction, we advocate for centralization of the management and oversight of college football referees.",2015 Mit Sloan sports analytics conference,"Brymer, R.","Holcomb, T.

One of the open problems in this field is the valuation of football players. The aim of this study is to establish a football player value assessment model using machine learning techniques to support transfer decisions of football clubs. The proposed models will mainly be based on the intrinsic features of the individual players which are provided in Football Manager video game. To do this, based on the individual statistics of 5316 players who are active in 11 different major leagues from Europe and South America, different value assessment models are conducted using advanced supervised learning techniques like ridge and lasso regressions, random forests and extreme gradient boosting. All the models have been built in R programming language. The performances of the models are compared based on their mean squared errors.

The transfer value of football players proliferates each year and transfer records get shattered every other transfer window. Players are signed with a certain transfer fee which is determined during the transfer of that player. However, it is noteworthy to have a metric or economic valuation signifying the price tag on a player throughout the season rather than only during the transfer. This paper introduces the contribution of consistency, popularity, crowd estimation and performance parameters on top of the factors used in previous studies in predicting market value of the player using machine learning algorithms.

Machine learning is being used in virtually all areas in one way or another, due to its extreme effectiveness. One such area where predictive systems have gained a lot of popularity is the prediction of football match results. This paper demonstrates our work on the building of a generalized predictive model for predicting the results of the English Premier League. Using feature engineering and exploratory data analysis, we create a feature set for determining the most important factors for predicting the results of a football match, and consequently create a highly accurate predictive system using machine learning. We demonstrate the strong dependence of our models’ performances on important features. Our best model using gradient boosting achieved a performance of 0.2156 on the ranked probability score (RPS) metric for game weeks 6 to 38 for the English Premier League aggregated over two seasons (2014–2015 and 2015–2016), whereas the betting organizations that we consider (Bet365 and Pinnacle Sports) obtained an RPS value of 0.2012 for the same period. Since a lower RPS value represents a higher predictive accuracy, our model was not able to outperform the bookmaker’s predictions, despite obtaining promising results.",International Journal of Forecasting,"Baboota, R.","Kaur, H.",-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-,-
